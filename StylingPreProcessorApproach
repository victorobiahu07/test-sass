#Phase 1: Creating a mock up using resources provided
I followed node and npm deployment over terminal from Homebrew.
I ran the command "npm start" first 
Then"npm run serve" next
  
The design is a mock up of an Adobe Xd static wire frame mirroring the screen from the readme provided earlier https://cadent.invisionapp.com/share/CMQTL3U5TBS#/screens   This allows for smooth representation of the original "client" design in terms of desired colors, svg resources, and general layout.


#Phase 2: Build (Used mixin and automation)

The animation utilizes some JavaScript to control the application of a `show` class on the parent elements making up the sidebar. 
The other animations and styles were created using Sass  transpiled into CSS using the `style:watch` script written in the package.json file. 
The transition effect was abstracted into its own mixin and stored with other scalable styles in the config.scss file. The color scheme is represented in the design by variables that are referenced in the menu.scss file and modified by the config file at will from the sidebar.

Pseudo-selectors were used to target the children of the menu toggle button (using `:nth-child`) and specify a `transform` animation. I used hover for mouse over detection in the menu.scss file for styling purposes. I tried to ensure uniformity in design throughout the page
